## Agenda

### Status updates

* There hasn't been much progress since the last telcon July 5, 2015,
  due to the summer break. Let's get started again!
* Poster "Open high-level data formats and software for gamma-ray astronomy"
was presented at the Gamma 2016 conference (see [PDF](https://github.com/open-gamma-ray-astro/open-gamma-ray-astro-gamma2016/blob/master/open-gamma-ray-astro-gamma2016.pdf).
Proceeding due in October, Christoph will write a draft.


* Any further contributions (updates from CTA or other IACTs, updates from science tools, anything else)?

### To be discussed

* [Issue 64: Change OBS_ID keyword from integer to string](https://github.com/open-gamma-ray-astro/gamma-astro-data-formats/issues/64)
* A second face-to-face meeting to follow up on the one from April 2016
  in Meudon
  * Christoph or Catherine could host in Heidelberg or Paris.
  * Duration: 3 or 4 or 5 days?
  * Focus just on IACT DL3, or also allow (parallel) session on
    * DL4, DL5 format spec
    * Connection to lower-level info, e.g. MC parameters
    * Multi-messenger use cases or how to support e.g. HAWC with similar formats.
    * CTA data challenge
  * When?
    * October doesn't work

* Anything else?
