## Agenda

### Status updates

* Christoph gave a presentation on "Open data and tools for gamma-ray astronomy"
  ([PDF](http://www.g-vo.org/edp-forum-2016/slides/deil-opengamma.pdf))
  * Feedback: for sustainability fo the open gamma-ray astronomy spec effort,
    consider forming a VO interest or working group.
    * This was discussed over lunch with Catherine Boisson, Mathieu Servillat and
      Christoph Deil and it wasn't clear to us if forming such an official group
      would help with organisation and sustainability.
  * Feedback: consider using [IVOA DataLink](http://www.ivoa.net/documents/DataLink/)
    for IACT DL3 data links (e.g. link EVENTS to IRFs).
    * "This document describes the linking of data discovery metadata to access
       to the data itself, further detailed metadata, related resources,
       and to services that perform operations on the data."
    * An XML VOTable file.
    * Could maybe replace what we do now to link HDUs
      ([data store in the spec ](http://gamma-astro-data-formats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_storage/))
      which was controversial at the f2f meeting and is probably not the final solution.
* Spec updates
  * ...

### To be discussed

* Action items for spec 1.0.
  * Which are required / optional?
  * What's the timeline?
* Maybe: Present and discuss DataLink option?
* Present and discuss Gamma2016 poster draft.
